<!--s-->

## Why Containerization?

A **container** is a lightweight, portable, and efficient way to package applications and their dependencies. Containers isolate applications from the host system and other containers, making them easier to deploy and manage.

| **Container** | **Virtual Machine** |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Lightweight | Heavyweight |
| Faster startup | Slower startup |
| Less resource usage | More resource usage |
| Shared kernel | Separate kernel |

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> The **kernel** is the core of an operating system that manages system resources. </span>

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> **Virtual machines** are software emulations of physical computers that run an operating system and applications. </span>

<!--s-->

## What is Docker and Why is it Useful?

**Docker** is an open-source platform designed to simplify the process of creating, deploying, and running applications. You can think of Docker as a self-contained package that includes everything an application needs to run: the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 

This package is called a **image**. When you run an image, it creates a **container**, an isolated environment that runs the application.

> <span style="font-style: normal;">An **image** is a snapshot of an application and its dependencies. </span>

> <span style="font-style: normal;">A **container** is a running instance of an image. </span>

## Benefits of Using Docker

1. Consistency Across Environments

2. Efficiency

3. Scalability

4. Isolation and Security

<!--s-->

## Benefits of Using Docker | Consistency

<div class = "col-wrapper" style = "height: 70%;">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%;">

Docker ensures that software behaves the same on every machine. Developers can be confident that applications that work on their computers will work in production.

Docker containers are typically based on a Linux distribution, which provides a consistent environment for applications.

<!--s-->

## Benefits of Using Docker | Efficiency


Containers share the host's operating system kernel, which makes them more lightweight and efficient than traditional virtual machines.

This results in faster application delivery, reduced resource consumption, and lower overhead.

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Daemon

The **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`) is the heart of Docker, responsible for running containers on a host. It listens for API requests and manages Docker objects (images, containers, networks, etc.).

<div class = "col-wrapper">

<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*G82uZfX0ozIih3-_" height="50%" style = "border-radius: 10px;">

<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> A **daemon** is a background process that runs continuously, waiting for requests to process. </span>

</div>

</div>


<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Client

The **Docker Client** is a command-line tool (CLI) used by the user to interact with the Docker daemon. 

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Common CLI commands include <span class="code-span">docker pull</span>, <span class="code-span">docker build</span>, and <span class="code-span">docker run</span>. The client sends commands to the daemon, which executes them on the host.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Images

**Docker Images** are immutable, read-only templates used to create containers.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

An image might include an OS, application code, and dependencies required to run an application. Images are built from a series of layers. Each layer represents a modification to the previous layer, allowing for efficient storage and distribution of images.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

</div>
</div>


<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Containers

**Docker Containers** are running instances of Docker images.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

They can be started, stopped, moved, or deleted using Docker commands. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but they share the host OS's kernel. This makes them lightweight and efficient.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;">NordicAPIs</p>

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Registries

**Docker Registries** store Docker images. A popular public registry is Docker Hub, but private registries can also be used. Docker images can be pushed to and pulled from registries, allowing for easy distribution and sharing of images.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Other examples of registries include:

- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
- **Google Container Registry (GCR)**
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

## Docker Architecture | Core Concepts

### Namespaces and Control Groups
Docker uses Linux namespaces to provide isolation for containers and control groups (cgroups) to limit resource usage.

### Union File System
Layers are used to create Docker images. Each layer is a modification over the previous one, which allows efficient storage and reduced bandwidth usage when distributing an image. A Union File System (UFS) combines these layers into a single view (union) of the file system.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

## Using Docker

1. Installing Docker
2. Building from a Dockerfile
3. Running Containers

<!--s-->

## Using Docker | Installing Docker

To start using Docker, you need to install the Docker Engine on your machine. It can be downloaded from the Docker website and is available for various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Download Docker Desktop: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

<!--s-->

## Using Docker | Building a Dockerfile

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

A **Dockerfile** is a text document that contains all the commands needed to assemble a Docker **image**. It starts with a <span class="code-span">FROM</span> instruction that specifies the base image. 


Usually, it also includes commands like <span class="code-span">WORKDIR</span>, <span class="code-span">COPY</span>, <span class="code-span">RUN</span>, and <span class="code-span">CMD</span> to set up the environment and run the application.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

```dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image.
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app.
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt.
# RUN is used to execute commands during the build process.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Start the application. CMD specifies the command to run when the container starts.
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

```

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Dockerfile | Cheatsheet

Here are some common Dockerfile commands.


| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <span class="code-span">FROM</span> | Specifies the base image to use. |
| <span class="code-span">WORKDIR</span> | Sets the working directory for subsequent commands. |
| <span class="code-span">COPY</span> | Copies files from the host to the container. |
| <span class="code-span">RUN</span> | Executes commands during the build process. |
| <span class="code-span">CMD</span> | Specifies the command to run when the container starts. |
| <span class="code-span">EXPOSE</span> | Exposes a port to the host machine. |
| <span class="code-span">ENV</span> | Sets environment variables. |
| <span class="code-span">ENTRYPOINT</span> | Configures the container to run as an executable. |
<!--s-->

## Docker | CLI Cheatsheet

Here are some common Docker CLI commands.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| <span class="code-span">docker --version</span> | Checks the installed version of Docker. |
| <span class="code-span">docker pull [image_name]</span> | Pulls an image from a registry. |
| <span class="code-span">docker build -t [image_name] .</span> | Builds an image from a Dockerfile. |
| <span class="code-span">docker run [image_name]</span> | Runs a container from an image, common flags include <span class="code-span">-d</span> for detached mode, <span class="code-span">-p</span> for port mapping, and <span class="code-span">-v</span> for volume mounting. |
| <span class="code-span">docker ps</span> | Lists running containers. |

## Docker Demo

Let's see Docker in action. Many of you working on Windows had difficulty installing the <span class="code-span">cs326</span> requirements for local development.

Imagine you could run the course env locally with minimal setup... Let's see how Docker can help with that.

<!--s-->

## Docker Demo | Course Environment

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

To the right is a dockerfile that will install the course environment and run <span class="code-span">code-server</span> in a container. 

This will allow you to run the course environment locally without installing any dependencies to your operating system (Windows, MacOS, Linux).

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 70%; height: 100%;">

```dockerfile
# Use the official Miniconda3 image as a parent image.
FROM continuumio/miniconda3

# Clone the class repository.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl
RUN git clone https://github.com/drc-cs/WINTER25-CS326.git

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /WINTER25-CS326

# Create a new Conda environment from the environment.yml file.
RUN conda env create -f environment.yml

# Install vscode server.
RUN curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | bash

# Add code-server to PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:${PATH}"

# Expose the port that the server is running on.
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the code-server command when the container starts.
CMD ["code-server", "--auth", "none", "--bind-addr", "0.0.0.0:8080", "."]

```

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Docker Demo | Running the Course Environment

Since we run the <span class="code-span">code-server</span> on port 8080, we need to map the container's port to the host machine. We can do this using the <span class="code-span">-p</span> flag. Here we mapped the container's port 8080 to the host machine's port 8080. Since code-server is already running within the docker container, we can access it by visiting <span class="code-span">localhost:8080</span> in your browser.

As long as the container is running, you can access the course environment by visiting <span class="code-span">localhost:8080</span> in your browser at any time. It will even work offline!

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

```bash
# Build the Docker image.
docker build -t cs326-env .

# Run the Docker container on port 8080 (local).
docker run -p 8080:8080 cs326-env
```
